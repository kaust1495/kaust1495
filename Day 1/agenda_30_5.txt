Welcome to Module Softwarwe Development Methodology
Let us  use music, video, interactions, and ofcourse learning expereincd togegher 

I do understand it is post lunch session.
Let us make fun of it.

We are going through process of Building Software for OnlineShopping 


	ECommerce Solution 
			to be designed, 
			   developed, tested and 
			   deployed to Commerce company

	Ravi Tambades way:

		Qualification is not a barrier

			BA,-------------------IT course --------------you can do it
			BCOM------------------IT course --------------you can do it
			

			MCA-------------------IT course --------------you can do it
			BSc-------------------IT course--------------you can do it
			BTech-----------------IT course--------------you can do it
			BE--------------------IT course--------------you can do it

		We always learn process, pattern in our life daily
			So why can we follow same in Software ???????????????????????????????????????

			Yes we can .......
			
			Let us become good engineer. IT Engineer.


			Art of Science...... using Creative way


			BE:
				Engineering: applied Science 
					     art of Science

					process
					practices
					Patterns:   production

					Design

			Software Engineering:

			Engineering:
			( Software Development Methodology)

			Software: ?
			Development:  ?

			This is what we are going to learn in practally

			Methodology:
				Agile Methodology
				Scrum
				CD/CI (	Continous Delivery/ continous integration)
				Automation Testing
				
			Roles played in IT company:
				You could have one role or you could play multiple role in  your IT Job
			In SDM , you would go through each and every role for bulding ECommerce Solution.
			You would get clarity of each and every role :
					B.Analyst  S.Analyst
					System Designer
					Software Architect
					Software Quality (QA)
					Automation Testing, Mannual Testing
					Operations Management
					DevOps
					Deployment

                     
		Do not think just Coding as a skill to build
		Try to  understanding Programmer Role
		Get your self for Developer Profile ( Fullstack)
		We want to become Solution Provider in long run as per industry expectation
		  
		 FullStack Developer                    
			Developer focuses on language : C++, Java, Adv. Java, C # .net, Python
		 We want to focus on higher level

			Java Fullstack
			.NET FullStack
			MEAN , MERN , MEVN  Javascript full, these all  you are going to learn in next 
			Modules.
		SDM is preparing for you for above things

			
			
Programming Languages are important:
	But Foundation is most important
		These are differnt languages are used to build software:
			Pascal, Cobol, Fortran	
			C,C++, 	
			Javascript, HTML
			java, C#, , Python, Typescript, 
			Ruby
			Go, Dart


ECommerce Solution to be designed, developed, tested and deployed to Commerce company
		using Software Development Methologies
			
	We are learning these things in SDM from the context of ECommerce Solution.


			Architecture:
					Microservices
			Framework:
					MVC
			Object Model:
					UML
			Analysis
					Requirement Engineering
			Design
					Object Oriented Design
			Development
					scrum,
					User stories
					Product catalog
					sprint
			SDLC
					Waterfall
					Spiral model;
			Tools: we are going to have practical for folling tools and technologies during SDM .

					Git
					Jira
		 			AWS
					docker
					kubernetes

	This is going to be our shedule for each day. So keep your self reserved.....

What do you mean by DevOps ?

Dev:Development
	Building Software

Ops:Operations Managment
  	Software Administration
	Configuration management
	Release management
	Keeping software running

		Library-----------------(set of packages)
		Object Model------------
		Architecture
		Framework---------------------Spring MVC, DJango, asp.net mvc, express JS, etc.


Now let us focus on What do you mean by Software: ?

	 System Sotware
	 Application Software
	 	Files
	 	Binary File
		 Executable files
				windows native file	.exe ,.dll 
				platform independent excutable file
							.class file    .jar file

		 Open Source files
				Source Code:
				Open source code will be stored at centralized place ( Code repository)
				

		 scripts
	 
IT Solution:
		Domain:  Ecommerce
		Solution:OnlineShopping Portal
		Type of Solution:
				 Portal
		Type of Application:
